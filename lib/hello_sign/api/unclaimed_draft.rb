    module UnclaimedDraft

      #
      # Creates a new Draft that can be claimed using the claim URL.
      # The first authenticated user to access the URL will claim the Draft and will be shown either the "Sign and send" or the "Request signature" page with the Draft loaded.
      # Subsequent access to the claim URL will result in a 404 not found.
      # If the type is "send_document" then only the file parameter is required.
      # If the type is "request_signature", then the identities of the signers and optionally
      # the location of signing elements on the page are also required.
      # @option opts [Integer] test_mode (0) Whether this is a test, the signature request will not be legally binding if set to 1.
      # @option opts [Array<String>] files Use files to indicate the uploaded file(s) to send for signature. Currently we only support use of either the files parameter or file_urls parameter, not both.
      # @option opts [Array<String>] file_urls Use file_urls to have HelloSign download the file(s) to send for signature. Currently we only support use of either the files parameter or file_urls parameter, not both.
      # @option opts [String] type The type of unclaimed draft to create. Use "send_document" to create a claimable file, and "request_signature" for a claimable signature request. If the type is "request_signature" then signers name and email_address are not optional.
      # @option opts [String] subject The subject in the email that will be sent to the signers.
      # @option opts [String] message The custom message in the email that will be sent to the signers.
